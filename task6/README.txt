Helle again!

In this assignment, I implemented a deque.
1. Actually, the implementation of the two-way queue in the file Deque.java. Note that since the list type is typically implemented as a dynamic array, it is generally cheaper to add to the tail of an array than to add to the head. That is why in my implementation of the deque, the sequence itself is somehow inverted to smooth out the resource costs.

2. A simple function that uses a two-way queue to determine if the given string is a palindrome.

Tests for all classes are in the tests directory.
