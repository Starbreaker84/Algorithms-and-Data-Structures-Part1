Well, there's a new challenge ahead!

In this assignment, I had to perform several tasks, namely:

1. Make your own implementation of the stack, choosing the appropriate type in the Java language.
You can see my solution in the file Stack.java.

2. Change the implementation of the stack so that it does not work with the tail of the list as the top of the stack, but with its head - based on an appropriate data structure that would preserve O (1) complexity.
You can see my solution in the file InvertedStack.java.

3. Write a function that takes as input a string consisting of opening and closing brackets (for example, "(()((())()))" or "(()()(()") and using only the stack and loop statement, determine if the parentheses in that line are balanced.
You can see my solution in the file StringAnalyzer.java.

4. Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression like 1 2 + 3 *, which means (1 + 2) * 3 in normal notation.
You can see my solution in the file PostfixExpression.java.

Tests for all classes are in the tests directory.

Your comments and constructive criticism are welcome!
