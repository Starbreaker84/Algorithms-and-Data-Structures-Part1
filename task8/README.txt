In this assignment, I implemented a simple hash table based on the probing method. The hash calculation function is also quite trivial, based on the sum of the character values in the value. I know that this is far from the most efficient way to organize a hash table, but this is a case study.

As usual, the source code is in the HashTable.java file, the tests are in a separate directory.
